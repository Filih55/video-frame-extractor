## 🚀 Demo / Usage

1. **Open the tool** in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
2. **Upload a video** via drag & drop or file picker.
3. The tool automatically detects video dimensions, FPS, and rotation.
4. Adjust extraction parameters (frame range, interval, format, quality, rotation override).
5. Click **Start Extraction** – frames will be captured and displayed in the gallery.
6. **Download** individual frames or the entire set as a ZIP file.

> 💡 **Pro tip**: Use the keyboard arrow keys to step through frames before extraction to find the perfect range.

## 🧠 How It Works

- The video is loaded into an HTML5 `<video>` element.
- Frame extraction is done by drawing the current video frame onto a hidden `<canvas>`.
- Rotation is applied either automatically (from metadata) or manually via canvas transformation.
- The `requestVideoFrameCallback` API ensures frame-accurate seeking (fallback to `seeked` event).
- Extracted frames are stored as Blobs and displayed using object URLs.
- JSZip + FileSaver.js are used to package frames into a ZIP archive.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5 / CSS3** – semantic markup, Tailwind CSS for styling
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – core logic, async processing, DOM manipulation
- **Canvas API** – frame rendering and rotation
- **File API** – video file handling and Blob management
- **JSZip** – ZIP archive creation
- **FileSaver.js** – client-side file download
